A simple REST API written in Golang made for practice.

## Features:

- [x] Get all Blogs
- [x] Get a single blog based on ID
- [x] Add a new blog
- [x] Restructure code
- [x] Add persistent data store using SQL database.
- [x] Add admin auth so only they can add new blogs

## TODO

- [ ] Dockerize the whole setup
- [ ] A simple frontend to display blogs
- [ ] (maybe) Markdown parsing for blogs
